# Patatap-Clone-Project
This awesome Patatap clone was built using a couple of fun JavaScript libraries that I wanted to try out. Using HTML Canvas and Javascript I was able to create some really cool and colourful effects. The sounds used are from the Open Source Patatap sound library. It's fun, just try all the keys and see if you can come up with a nice tune
